## Description

It consists of three pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The website allows users to perform regular searches, image searches, and advanced searches just like the original Google website.

## Features

- Three pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
- Links to navigate between pages in the upper-right corner.
- A centered search bar with rounded corners.
- A centered search button beneath the search bar.
- Google Search: Users can enter a query and click "Google Search" to view search results.
- Google Image Search: Users can enter a query and click a search button to view image search results.
- Google Advanced Search: Users can provide input for four search fields: "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words." Clicking the "Advanced Search" button displays the search results for the given query.
- Consistent CSS styling with Google's own aesthetics.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Navigate to the `index.html` file to access the Google Search page.

4. Click on the links in the upper-right corner to switch between Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search pages.

5. Perform searches on each page using the search bar and buttons.

6. For Advanced Search, enter the desired search criteria in the respective fields and click the "Advanced Search" button.

7. To use the "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature, enter your search query in the search bar on the Google Search page and click the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. This will directly take you to the first Google search result for your query.

**Note**: You may encounter a redirect notice when using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
